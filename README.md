# Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-Analysis-using-Power-BI
This project was done as part of the Virtual Internship program organized by TCS. 

This HR analytics dashboard examines attrition patterns for 1,470 employees across 3 departments using Power BI, Excel, Power Query and DAX, uncovering key workforce risks related to compensation, job level, demographics, performance, and work environment. Insights support data-driven retention strategies, particularly for Sales and early-career employees (25–34 yrs) who exhibit the highest turnover rates.

 I have uploaded the project reports, source files and code files for perusal.
